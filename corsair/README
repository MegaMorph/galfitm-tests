 ====================
 
This is an example file set for a quick test of GALFIT-CORSAIR fitting a core-Sersic model.

The image data have been obtained from the Hubble Legacy Archive (HLA) for NGC 5557, in the
F555W filter.

Files:
------

> counts_NGC5557_WFPC2_F555W.fits
   
  HLA image, converted to ADUs (from electrons/second), using the header information.
  
> INPUT

  Input GALFIT file reporting first-guess model parameters.
  
> mask.fits

  Mask image.  

> PSF.fits

  Artificial PSF image, built with the Tiny Tim (Krist et al. 2011) software.
  
> sigma.fits

  Sigma image obtained by running GALFIT with the command-line parameters:
      -skyped 0.81
      -skyrms 0.18  

  See Bonfini (2014, PASP) for the estimation of the sky level in HLA images

> 4D_counts_NGC5557_WFPC2_F555W.fits

  GALFIT image/model/residuals four-dimensional output FITS file.


Run the test:
-------------     

Coherently with the standard GALFIT procedure, simply type in a terminal:

%> ./galfit-3.0.5-corser_v3 -outsig INPUT -skyped 0.81 -skyrms 0.18
